# Transportation to snow
Project_2

Project Description:
This analytic tool will provide a niche transportation business data to enhance their business decisions process. 
This is a growing multi-modal transportation business that requires analytic tools to know where to grow their operations and maximize their resources. The tool will help the business development team and operations team to determine:
        •    First visualization will map where all US ski resorts are based since this is a national transportation company. This data will be used to determine where the business should establish new offices based on concentration of ski resorts as well as which ski resorts to market transportation services to,
        •    Second visualization will show which resorts received most snow within the last 24 and 72 hours to aid scheduling operations about transportation demands i.e.  sports enthusiasts will want to travel to the resorts that have the freshest powder,
        •    Third visualization will make a recommendation where the transportation business should deploy and increase resources to meet transportation demands of the resorts or individuals.

Instructions to run the app:
1.    End user must secure a token key at mapbox.com. The JSON mapbox also requires the enduser to use their unique mapbox token key.
2.    End users will need to create a unique config.py file with the following four variables to run the app:
        •    mysql_un = ‘root’
        •    mysql_pw = ‘your_pw_here’
        •    mysql_uri = ‘localhost’
        •    mysql_port = 3306
